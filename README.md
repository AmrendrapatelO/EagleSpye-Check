# EagleSpye-Check

**EagleSpye-Check** is an open-source Remote Administration Tool (RAT) built in C# for educational and ethical purposes. This project is designed for developers, security researchers, and ethical hackers to understand how client-server architecture and remote control mechanisms work on Windows systems.

## Features

- Remote desktop screenshot viewing
- File system access (download/upload)
- Remote command execution
- Webcam capture
- System information collection
- Client management (multi-client support)

> **Note:** This tool is intended for legal and ethical use only, such as penetration testing in labs or personal systems with permission.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Framework 4.8
- TCP Socket Programming

- Send remote commands
- View or control file access
- Capture webcam or desktop
